                We hope this website will not only just be user-friendly but
                also price-friendly to students in NTU. Thus, the delivery
                charges have been removed so that students can enjoy and support
                the stores in NTU.

            <p>
              We are a group on NTU who are passionate about the NTU’s food!
              NTU’s canteen has been a big part of every student’s life. They
              serve various kind of cuisine, from breakfast to dinner, and
              occasionally suppper. However, ever since COVID-19 in 2019, it has
              affected both the canteen and student. With the ever-changing
              rules and regulations, students may find it hard to eat in canteen
              either due to lack of space or no-dine rules. Government has also
              frequently encouraged us to not stay in crowded areas and practice
              social distancing.

              <br />
              Thus, we have decided to come out with a food web where users are
              able to order food online and have them delivered to them. Not
              only will the students get to enjoy the food, they are also able
              to avoid the crowds and eat in their room’s comfortably.
