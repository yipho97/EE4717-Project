        <h1 style="text-align: center;">About Us!</h1>

        <div class=aboutus>
          We are a group on NTU who are passionate about the NTU’s food! NTU’s canteen has been a big part of every student’s life.
          They serve various kind of cuisine, from breakfast to dinner, and occasionally suppper.
          However, ever since COVID-19 in 2019, it has affected both the canteen and student.
          With the ever-changing rules and regulations, students may find it hard to eat in canteen either due to lack of space or no-dine rules.
          Government has also frequently encouraged us to not stay in crowded areas and practice social distancing.
          <br>
          <br>
          Thus, we have decided to come out with a food web where users are able to order food online and have them delivered to them.
          Not only will the students get to enjoy the food, they are also able to avoid the crowds and eat in their room’s comfortably.
